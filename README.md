Shopping Cart: View the plants added to your cart, along with options to increase or decrease quantities, remove items, and see the updated cost.
Buttons for Continuing Shopping and Checkout: Easy navigation to keep shopping or proceed to checkout.
Getting Started
To get started with Paradise Nursery, follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can verify the installation by running:


node -v
npm: npm comes bundled with Node.js, and you can verify it with:

npm -v
Installation
Clone the repository: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paradise-nursery.git
Navigate to the project directory: After cloning the repo, navigate into the project directory:

cd paradise-nursery
Install dependencies: Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies for the project:

npm install
Running the App
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:


npm start
This will launch the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000. You can now start interacting with the app and explore the features!

## How It Works
React Components: The app is built using React, where each plant is a separate component. Components are composed and nested to create the full page layout.
State Management: The app uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing state, including the shopping cart and product listings.
Redux: We use Redux to manage the global state of the cart, ensuring smooth interaction with product data across different components.
Styling: The app uses simple CSS (in App.css) to provide a clean and modern look.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
